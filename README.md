## From One Founder to Another

This platform was built out of the frustration of creating countless investor decks and business documents. Every startup needs these materials, but creating them from scratch is time-consuming and often results in inconsistent or incomplete documentation.

The goal is to help fellow entrepreneurs focus on building their businesses rather than wrestling with presentation software and document formatting.

If this helps your startup succeed, that's worth more than any GitHub star.

## Support

- Open an issue for bugs or feature requests
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
- For setup questions, refer to the documentation first
